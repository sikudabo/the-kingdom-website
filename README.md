# the-kingdom-website
This is a website for The Kingdom Venue. This is a new local bar that is leveraging technology to better satisfy its' customers. The Kingdom website allows users to order food online, get a delivery service for food and drinks, create social profiles to take pictures and record videos of events at the bar, allows local musicians to share their content in order to generate more fanfare, and users can chat with each other to find out who is attending the bar. The Kingdom Venue is leveraging technology more than most local bars. I worked on this web application for the bar by myself, and leveraged Node JS because this application it a data-intensive real-time application.
